# ASCI-MAZE
Generate a maze using ASCI symbols

This project will be about making an ASCI text maze generator. This skills learned from creating this asci maze can be transfered to other areas such as designs, video-games, and artwork.

This maze will not be a static image but will instead be blocks of ASCI text.

The language I will be using is C++ but any language can be used. Javascript is a great option.
There are many possible [maze generation algorithms]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Simple_algorithms)) that can be used to generate the maze

This project will have these features before it is considered a complete prototype

1. The user will generate a maze when prompted for 1. a width size, 2. length size, and 3. ASCI character to use for their in game character
2. The user will be able will start at the block designated to be the entrance
3. The user can move in empty spaces and must follow the path out of the maze
4. the user will collide with the asci characters making up the walls of the maze
5. When the user exits the maze they will be prompted with the option of ending the game or regenerating a new maze
